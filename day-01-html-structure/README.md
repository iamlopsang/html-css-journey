# Day 1 – HTML Basics 🧱

## 📝 What I Learned:
- How to structure an HTML document using `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`
- The usage of heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- How to write paragraphs using the `<p>` tag
- How to break lines using the `<br>` tag
- How to insert images using the `<img>` tag
- How to write comments in HTML for clarity

## 💡 Notes:
This is my first step into web development.  
I added comments to each element to help understand their purpose.

## 🖼️ Image Used:
![Relaxing Cat](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg)  
I used the `alt` attribute to provide an alternative text description, which appears if the image fails to load — it also improves accessibility for screen readers.
