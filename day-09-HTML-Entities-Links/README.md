# Day 09 – HTML Entities & Multi-Page Linking 🔗✨

## 📝 What I Learned:
    - How to use HTML entities like `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&copy;`, and `&nbsp;` to display special characters.
    - Why HTML entities are important to show reserved characters in HTML.
    - How to create a simple multi-page website with 3 linked pages: Home, About, and Contact.
    - How to create a navigation bar using `<a href="">` links for easy page navigation.
    - How to add a footer with copyright symbol using HTML entities.

## 💡 Notes:
    - Entities help display special characters without breaking HTML.
    - Using multiple HTML pages helps organize website content.
    - Navigation links make it easy for users to browse your site.
