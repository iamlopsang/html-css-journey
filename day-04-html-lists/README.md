Day 4 – HTML Lists 📋
📝 What I Learned:
### The three main types of lists in HTML:
    # Unordered List(<ul>) for bullet points
    # Ordered List(<ol>) for numbered steps
    # Definition List(<dl>, <dt>, <dd>) for terms and definition

  # How to create nested lists within list items
  # The semantic structure and best practices for writing lists
  # When to use each list type in real-world web development

💡 Notes:
  # Each list item is created using the <li> tag inside either <ul> or <ol>.
  # Nested lists are especially useful for sub-categories like shopping items, FAQs, or menus.
  # I practiced writing a grocery list and a definition list of programming languages.
  # Comments in the HTML help me understand and revise later.
