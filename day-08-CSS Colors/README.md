# Day 8 – CSS Colors 🎨

    ## 📝 What I Learned
    -Today I explored **different ways to apply colors in CSS**. -Colors can be written using keywords, HEX values, RGB, -RGBA, HSL, and HSLA. Each method gives flexibility in how -colors are displayed, including transparency.

## 📚 Key Points
    1.Color Keyword → Example: `color: green;`
    2.HEX → Example: `color: #FF5733;`
    3.RGB (Red, Green, Blue) → Example: `color: rgb(0, 128, 255);`
    4.RGBA (with Alpha for transparency) → Example: `color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);`
    5.HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) → Example: `color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);`
    6.HSLA (with Alpha) → Example: `color: hsla(120, 100%, 25%, 0.8);`

## 🔍 My Observations
    - (Keywords) are simple but limited.
    - (HEX & RGB) are widely used for web design.
    - (RGBA & HSLA) are powerful for adding transparency.
    - (HSL/HSLA) are easier to tweak visually compared to RGB.

## ✅ Output Preview
    - The `<h1>` is red, underlined, and centered.
    - Paragraphs show different color formats with slight style variations.
    - Transparency (RGBA & HSLA) makes text blend with the background.
