# Day 10 – HTML Semantics 🏷️

## 📌 What I Learned:
    - The purpose of **semantic HTML** for better structure, SEO, and accessibility.
    - Usage of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>`.
    - Importance of `<nav>` for navigation menus.
    - How `<aside>` is used for related but not primary content.
    - Proper way to use `<time>` for date-related content.
    - Opening external links in new tabs using `target="_blank"`.
    - Using HTML entities like `&copy;` for special symbols.

## 🛠️ Project Details:
Created a **Mini Blog Page** using semantic HTML tags.

### Key Features:
    - **Header** with blog title and navigation links.
    - **Main** section containing an `<article>` for the blog post.
    - **Aside** with related topics and learning links.
    - **Footer** with copyright.
    - External links to social media profiles.
