# Day 11 – CSS Margins and Padding 📦

## 📝 What I Learned:
    - 'Margins' create space (outside) of an element’s border.
    - 'Padding' creates space (inside) an element, between content and border.

## (Content-box vs Border-box) in CSS:
    - `content-box`: Width/height applies only to the content. Padding and border are added outside this size.

    - `border-box`: Width/height includes content, padding, and border.

## 📂 Project Structure:
    - (index.html) → Demonstrates margins, padding, and box-sizing properties.
    - (styles.css) → Contains styling for body, paragraphs, content-box, and border-box.

## 🎯 Key Features:
    - A `content-box` example with padding and margin.
    - A `border-box` example showing how padding and border fit inside the set width/height.
    - Styled navigation links inside the border-box.
