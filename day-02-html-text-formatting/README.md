# Day 2 – HTML Text Formatting ✍️

## 📝 What I Learned:
- How to emphasize text using `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, and `<i>`
- Highlighting and minimizing text with `<mark>` and `<small>`
- Showing removed and added text using `<del>` and `<ins>`
- Writing subscript and superscript with `<sub>` and `<sup>`
- Underlining text with `<u>`, breaking lines with `<br>`, and inserting horizontal lines using `<hr>`
- Using `<abbr>` with the `title` attribute for abbreviations
- Quoting content using `<blockquote>` for block quotes and `<q>` for inline quotes
- Displaying inline code using `<code>`

## 💡 Notes:
Each tag is explained with comments in the HTML file for better understanding.  
This practice helped me understand the difference between semantic and non-semantic formatting tags.
