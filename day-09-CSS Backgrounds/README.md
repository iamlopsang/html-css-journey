# Day 9 – CSS Backgrounds 🎨

## 📝 What I Learned:
    -Today I practiced **CSS background properties**. These properties are used to control how backgrounds -appear on elements such as the `body`, `div`, or any other block-level tag.  

### ✅ Properties Used:
    1.`background-color` → Adds a solid color in the background.  
    2.`background-image` → Sets an image as the background.  
    3.`background-size` → Defines how the background image should fit (e.g., `contain`, `cover`, or custom size).  
    4.`background-repeat` → Controls how/if the image repeats (e.g., `repeat-x`, `repeat-y`, `no-repeat`).  
    5.`background-attachment` → Sets whether the background scrolls with the page (`scroll`) or stays fixed (`fixed`).  

## 💻 Code Summary:
    - The body has a `background-color` + `background-image` with properties like `contain`, `repeat-y`, and `scroll`.  
    - The `.background` div has its own `background-image`, fixed attachment, custom size, padding, and margin.  
    - `text-shadow` was used on the heading to give a stylish effect.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways:
    - Always use (high-quality images) that are free or properly credited.  
    - `background-size: cover` is great for full-screen images, while `contain` fits inside an element.  
    - Avoid using heavy images in the background to keep page performance fast.
